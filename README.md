# ringsig.js
A library for working with ring signatures in the browser

To make this library I simply ran Beritani's ring signature implementation through webpack so that it would work in the browser.

https://github.com/beritani/ring-signatures

Therefore the same caveat from his library applies here:

```
I am a Software Engineer not a Cryptographer.

This library is only to aid in the understanding and the application of ring signatures. It is almost certain to contain errors, inaccuracies and incorrect implementations.
```

# Attribution

This library uses the noble cryptographic libraries by @paulmillr and the ring signatures library by @beritani. Huge thanks!
